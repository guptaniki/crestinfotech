JavaScript is a browser based programming language.

That means you do not need any kind of idea or any kind of software to be installed on your computerto learn or run JavaScript.

The only thing you need to run JavaScript is just a browser and a notepad, and you can use any latestbrowser like Chrome or Safari Firefox.

Anything will work fine.So there's no specific recommendation that you have to use no purpose, sublime visual studio code or nothing like that.

One of the most amazing parts of JavaScript is that is it is simple and it is easy to start and learn.

JavaScript is used in bigger applications like Acrobat Photoshop and many other popular applications.

JavaScript is also used in the Summerside programming like Narges and Google Apps.
So if you check out some of the history of JavaScript, JavaScript was first developed in 1995 and was Then the descript was renamed to ECMAScript in 1997 and in 1999 the official name was called three.In 2009, JavaScript release the ECMAScript and the leaders currently now which is available is ESX.

iOS seven is still under development and it requires a lot of functionality.

Ethics and S7 will not be covered in this course, although you're going to go until SFI and you're

going to learn all the essential parts of the JavaScript.
